# Maintaining Dib It

## Updating the semester info

Every semester and year, you must update the [semester info](./src/semesterInfo.tsx) file.
Make sure to add new semesters to the `semesterInfo` variable and update the `currentSemester` variable.

## Updating the courses

Dib It fetches the current semester's courses given in Tel Aviv University from the Arazim website.
This means they should be regularly updated by members of the Arazim Project.
If not, you can contact the project using the [feedback page](https://arazim-project.com/contact-us).
